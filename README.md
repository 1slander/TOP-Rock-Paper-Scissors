# TOP-Rock-Paper-Scissors

First JavaScript Project from: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

This game is console base, so you need to activate the Developer Tools on your search engine.

What I've learned:

- A better understanding of how functions work.
- Working with the different types of errors.

This time we will need to work on a UI and also on manipulate the DOM through Javascript.

        - Use the new git branch.
        - Add a UI and make the game playable by clicking buttons
        - Put into practice the DOM manipulation methods learnt on the previous unit.

Working on the UI - TOP Things To Do :

In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.

1. For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.

2. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)

3. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.

4. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.

5. You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.
